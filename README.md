#### Why you ain't scripting dat cray configuration process fo dat new dev, doe?

I think we should not make developers do several days of configuration before they can get to work. 
It may seem like a good way to test their skills, to an outsider, but; 

The man who was talkin' to the dog

Looked at the dog an' he said: (sort of staring in disbelief)

"You can't say that!"

He said:
- a) IT HASN'T 
- b) IT ISN'T 
- c) IT EVEN AIN'T
- d) AND IT SHOULDN'T 
- e) IT COULDN'T!
- f) they told me "NO NO NO"
- g) I told them "YES YES YES"
- f#) I said, "I DO IT ALL THE TIME"
- c#) Ain't this boogie a mess?
- g#) The poodle bites
- d#) The poodle chews it

So I made a naive little shell script for Macys.com to speed up the process of on-boarding new QE developers.
Is anybody out there?
